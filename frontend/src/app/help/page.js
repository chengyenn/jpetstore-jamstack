      <p>
        The JPetStore Demo is an online pet store. Like most e-stores, you can
        browse and search the product catalog, choose items to add to a shopping
        cart, amend the shopping cart, and order the items in the shopping cart.
        You can perform many of these actions without registering with or
        logging into the application. However, before you can order items you
        must log in (sign in) to the application. In order to sign in, you must
        have an account with the application, which is created when you register
        (sign up) with the application.
